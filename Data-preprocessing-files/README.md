This folder contains processing scripts and illustrative iPython notebooks for inspecting, cleaning, and prepping the LTER data for a TopoFlow run. The processed files that are used to input to TopoFlow are provided in the Simulation Results folder (along with the other input files).

If you would like to run the scripts or the notebook content, you will need the raw input files. The discharge data file can be found [here](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.142.20). The precipitation data file can be found [here](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.167.19)--make sure to get the 4th (CPEAK) file.
